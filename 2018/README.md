This is a personal blog where we answer one or more questions each month from DataStax customers in a non-official, non-warranted, non much of anything forum. 

2018 December - -

>Customer: My developers want a quick and easy way to prototype Spark Scala, Spark Python, 
>and related. I know there are the Spark (Scala) and Python REPLs (read, evaluate, print and 
>loop; command prompts) that ship with DSE, but we want something more. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question! There are a number of free/open-source options here. In this document 
>we’ll install and use Apache Zeppelin to address this need.
>
>DSE Studio, based on Apache Zeppelin, ships with interpreters for; markdown, Spark/SQL, Gremlin, 
>and CQL. Apache Zeppelin ships with 20 or more interpreters, including Spark (Scala), Python, 
>Shell, and more. As such, many folks use both tools.

>Customer: My application needs to store a dynamic number of latitude/longitude pairs per single 
>database row, along with a tag for these values like; home, work, mobile, etcetera. We need to 
>perform distance (proximity) queries for any of the latitude/longitude pair values, as well as 
>queries on specific tags; just home, just work, other. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! All of these application requirements are easily served with DataStax 
>Enterprise Server (DSE). While we’ve covered DSE Search queries including spatial/geo-spatial in 
>past editions of this document, the specific requirement you have for (a dynamic count of attributes), 
>is something we have not covered in this series of documents previously.
>
>Using this same technique, DataStax Enterprise can also serve a polymorphic schema ability, 
>similar to MongoDB.
>
>This edition of this document will address this application requirement with no prerequisites, 
>although; you might well be served to visit the past editions of this document detailing DSE 
>Search and DSE (spatial/geo-spatial Search), to gain a deep understanding.

2018 October - - 

>Customer: My company is investigating using DataStax for our new Customer/360 system in our 
>customer call center. I am tasked with getting a simple (Hello World style) Java program 
>running against the DataStax server in a small Linux command line capable Docker container. 
>Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! In the May/2018 edition of this document, we detailed how and 
>where to download a DataStax sponsored Docker container which includes the DataStax Enterprise 
>(DSE) server; boot and operate DSE. In the October/2017 edition of this document, we detailed 
>a DSE introduction, including table create, new data insert and query, and more.
>
>So, the only piece we are missing is the Java client program compile that targets DSE. To aid 
>in our compiling, we will document using the Apache Maven build automation tool. Inherently, 
>a given (any given) Java library will need other Java libraries, that themselves need more 
>Java libraries, rinse and repeat. It is best to automate resolution of this condition.
>
>We will install and configure all of the above, access the DSE server, and go home.

>Customer: My company is investigating using DataStax for our new Customer/360 system in our 
>customer call center. I’m a developer, and do not know how to administer DataStax Enterprise, 
>but, I need to know how to backup and restore tables for my programming and unit tests. Can 
>you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! DataStax Enterprise (DSE) cab be backed up and restored using 
>DataStax Operations Center (DSE Ops Center), including activities to block stores like Amazon 
>S3, other. You can also perform sstabledump(s), and table unloads and loads, including bulk 
>unloads and loads.
>
>But, as you seek to perform these activities as part of your unit tests, we are going to detail 
>table backup and restore using snapshots; faster, less code, easily automated.

>Customer: My company is investigating using DataStax for our new Customer/360 system in our 
>customer call center. I’m a developer, and do not know how to administer DataStax Enterprise, 
>but, I need to know how to set up user authentication and authorization for my programming 
>and unit tests. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! Setting up authentication and authorization using DataStax 
>Enterprise (DSE) is super easy. Below we detail all of the relevant topics and steps to 
>achieve same, including source code for all. We detail table level access control, and in 
>the event you need it, row level access control.

2018 July - -

>Customer: I inherited an existing DataStax Enterprise (DSE) server system, and users are 
>complaining about performance. I know nothing about DSE, and need to make the users happy. 
>Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! Based on your timeline (how quickly and safely does this problem 
>need to be solved), you should probably contact DataStax for assistance. If you were already 
>trained/capable on DSE and wanted to solve this problem, this document will cover introductory 
>topics related to that goal.
>
>In short, this document discusses building a query harness; capturing and then executing a 
>representative set of queries to measure your system performance against, how and why-

>Customer: I'm confused by all of the options for loaders, developer's tools and similar. 
>Can you offer me an overvew, specifically detailing DSE Studio ?
>
>Daniel: Sure ! We overview all of the above, then detail install, configure and use of
>DSE Studio version 6.0, including configuration and use of CQL and Spark/SQL.

>Customer: My company is investigating using the cloud, containers including micro-services, 
>automated deployment tools (continuous innovation / continuous deployment), and more. Can you 
>help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! Huge and far ranging topics, obviously; we’ll offer a history 
>and primer on many of these pieces, a Cloud-101 if you will. Then, to offer some amount of 
>actionable content, we’ll delve a bit deeper into one container option, namely; Docker.

2018 April - -

>Customer: My company really enjoyed the last two documents in this series on the topic of 
>DataStax Enterprise (DSE) DSE Search, however; our application also needs to include geo-spatial 
>queries, specifically-
>
>• Find all points within a distance from a given point, including a compound Text Search.
>
>• Find all points within a polygon.
>
>• And while we’re at it; what is the best means to do end user testing of geo-spatial queries-
>
>Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! In this document we will:
>
>• Review DSE Search, overview the main points from last month’s edition of this document.
>
>• Deliver the two DSE Search geo-spatial queries you detail above.
>
>• Deliver a graphical (custom) application you could use for end user testing.
>
>** This docment states that the accompanying download contains 330,000 sample
>geo-points from the USA states of Colorado and Utah. This amount of data was 
>greater in size than GitHub cared for. So, you only get Colorado data at nearly
>220,000 geo-points.

2018 March - -

>Customer: My company wants to use the secondary indexes, part of DataStax Enterprise (DSE) 
>Search, more specfically the (first name) synonym and Soundex style features to aid in 
>customer call center record lookup. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! DataStax Enterprise (DSE) Search is one of the four primary 
>functional areas inside DSE; the others being DSE Core, DSE Analytics, and DSE Graph. 
>Built atop Apache Solr, DSE Search is a large topic. As such, we will detail the programming 
>(use) of DSE Search, and let this document serve as a primer of sorts.
>
>We plan follow up editions of this document to cover not just programming, but capacity 
>planning of DSE Search, and tuning of DSE Search.
>
>**Mar 21 - This document was heavily revised: 30 new pages of content, 2 errors corrected.**

2018 February - -

>Customer: My company was invited to participate in the DataStax Enterprise (DSE) 6.0 early 
>release program. From discussions with DataStax, we learned there are a number of changes 
>related to CQL native processing of DSE Search commands. Can you help us understand what 
>this means ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! On February 1, 2018, DataStax began accepting self nominations 
>to the DSE release 6.0 Early Access Process (EAP) at the following Url,
>
>https://academy.datastax.com/eap?destination=eap
>
>When your nomination is accepted, you receive early access to the DSE version 6.0 software 
>and documentation. In return, you are asked to formally test this release and participate 
>in feedback relative to your experiences. The 6.0 release is huge, with many topics far 
>larger than CQL native processing of DSE Search commands; this is a very cool, and strategic 
>release.
>
>In this document, we detail the DSE Core and DSE Search areas of functionality, their intent, 
>how they work pre release 6.0, and are planned to work in the 6.0 release. Further, we detail:
>
>• The four functional areas of DSE, including DSE Core with its network partition fault tolerance and time constant lookups.
>
>• We detail B-Tree+ and hash lookups, and which scale and why.
>
>• We define the DSE primary key, including its partitioning key and clustering key parts.
>
>• We detail what makes a query a DSE Core query versus a DSE Search query.
>
>• We highlight the new CQL native processing of DSE Search commands.
>
>• We overview DSE materialized views, and secondary indexes.
>
>• We detail how to add and drop table columns, and inform DSE Search indexes of same.
>
>• And we overview how to observe asynchronous/background index builds.

2018 January - -

>Customer: My company is investigating using the DataStax advanced replication feature to 
>move data between data centers. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel:
>Excellent question ! In this document we overview DataStax Enterprise (DSE) data replication, 
>advanced replication, and even recovery and diagnosis from failure of each of these sub-systems. 
>Also, since advanced replication falls into an area of DataStax Enterprise titled, ‘advanced 
>functionality’, we overview this topic as well.
>
>Just to be excessively chatty, we also detail DataStax Enterprise triggers and create yet 
>another user defined function (UDF). (UDFs were a topic we covered in last month’s edition of 
>this document.)
