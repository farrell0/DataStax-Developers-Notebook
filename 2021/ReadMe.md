This is a personal blog where we answer one or more questions each month from DataStax customers in a non-official, non-warranted, non much of anything forum. 

December 2021 - -
>Customer: My company uses a ton of Apache Cassandra, and a ton of SnowFlake. We also want to move to writing applications using Node.js/REACT. 
>We’re having trouble understanding what each of Cassandra and SnowFlake should be used for together, and what a sample application might 
>look like. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! We’ll detail a sample application, written in Node.js and REACT, and then deliver an application that uses both 
>Apache Cassandra and SnowFlake.

November 2021 - -
>Customer: My company has been on DataStax Enterprise for some time. We are super excited by the new, open source StarGate (subsystem), 
>and what that provides. It appears as though StarGate only works with open source Apache Cassandra. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! We’ll overview what you are seeing, and how to get StarGate to work with DataStax Enterprise. We’ll also 
>detail a bit of the landscape; what’s moving around, how and why.

October 2021 - -
>Customer: My company is investigating a backup and recovery solution for all of our applications running atop Kubernetes. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! In the past we’ve referenced the open source Velero project from a VMware acquisition, and we’ve mentioned 
>NetApp Astra (a SaaS). This month we detail installation and use of Kasten/Veeam K10. With (Kasten) you can backup and restore databases, 
>applications, and not only backup and restore, but also clone to aid your development efforts.
>
>In this article we backup and recover the DataStax Kubernetes Operator for Apache Cassandra, and backup, restore, and clone Cassandra
>Datacenter objects (entire Cassandra clusters).
