This is a personal blog where we answer one or more questions each month from DataStax customers in a non-official, non-warranted, non much of anything forum. 

September 2021 - -
>Customer: My company has enjoyed the last two articles on DataStax K8ssandra, and specifically the StarGate component to same. 
>We’ve seen details on REST and the Document API, but little on GraphQL. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question !  We’ve done a number of articles in this series on GraphQL. Most recently, in October/2020, we 
>delivered a geo-spatial thin client Web program using GraphQL against the DataStax database as a service. When using Astra, 
>the database is hosted, managed. Also when using Astra, the service end points are automatically created and maintained, and 
>are, behind the scenes, using K8ssandra and StarGate.
>
>So, in this article, we supply the final and previously missing piece; how to access the GraphQL component of your own hosted 
>K8ssandra/StarGate.

August 2021 - -
>Customer: My company enjoyed the last article on K8ssandra and StarGate. We are highly interested in the Document API that this 
>document referred to; use and some of the design elements. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! Last month we installed DataStax K8ssandra, which includes the StarGate component. Further, we did 
>a (Hello World) using REST, to serve as an install/validate of StarGate. This month we dive deeper not into just REST, but now 
>the Document API area of StarGate; make a table, insert documents, run a query.

July 2021 - -
>Customer: My company is looking for ways to accelerate our application development, through whatever means. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question !  One of the areas we can look at are programming APIs/gateways. On some level, there are only 
>four things you can do with data; insert, update, delete, and select. As such, why aren’t all means to execute these statements 
>automatically generated, automatically managed and scaled, and more.
>
>On February 10, 2021, DataStax released the open source K8ssandra project, which includes these automated functions, and more. 
>In this article, we detail an introduction to K8ssandra; installation and use. In subsequent articles, we dive deeper into REST, 
>GraphQL, and Document API configuration and use.

June 2021 - -
>Customer: My company is investigating using the DataStax Atra Service Broker within our Kubernetes systems. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! In this document we will install and use most of the early pieces of the DataStax Astra Service broker; install, 
>install verification, connection, yadda. By accident then, we instroduce Kuberenetes service brokers, broker instances, and (broker instance)
>bindings.

May 2021 - -
>Customer: My company enjoyed the series of four articles centered on Cassandra atop Kubernetes. But, you left Cassandra and the Operator limited to 
>just one namespace. We seek to run Cassandra clusters in many concurrent namespaces. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! In this edition of this document, we take the work from the previous 4 articles, and move them to a multiple namespace 
>treatment. We’ll detail using the Cassandra Operator across Kubernetes namespaces, and we’ll detail Cassandra cluster cloning across namespaces. Be 
>advised, there are relevant limitations with Kuberenetes version 1.18 and lower as it relates to (cloning) across namespaces. (Everything is do-able, 
>it’s just more steps than you might expect.)

January 2021 thru April 2021 - -
>Customer: My company is moving its operations to the cloud, including cloud native computing and Kubernetes. I believe we can run Apache Cassandra 
>on Kubernetes. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! Kubernetes, and running Apache Cassandra on Kuberenetes are huge topics. As such, we’ll begin a four part series of articles that 
>cover most of the day one through day seven topics. We wont do a general Kuberentes primer, many other capable Kubernetes primers exist, but will list our 
>favorite resources here and there. 
>
>  • In the January article, we will get Apache Cassandra up and running on Kubernetes.
