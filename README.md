This is a personal blog where we answer one or more questions each month from DataStax customers in a non-official, non-warranted, non much of anything forum. 

June 2021 - -
>Customer: My company is investigating using the DataStax Atra Service Broker within our Kubernetes systems. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! In this document we will install and use most of the early pieces of the DataStax Astra Service broker; install, 
>install verification, connection, yadda. By accident then, we instroduce Kuberenetes service brokers, broker instances, and (broker instance)
>bindings.

May 2021 - -
>Customer: My company enjoyed the series of four articles centered on Cassandra atop Kubernetes. But, you left Cassandra and the Operator limited to 
>just one namespace. We seek to run Cassandra clusters in many concurrent namespaces. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! In this edition of this document, we take the work from the previous 4 articles, and move them to a multiple namespace 
>treatment. We’ll detail using the Cassandra Operator across Kubernetes namespaces, and we’ll detail Cassandra cluster cloning across namespaces. Be 
>advised, there are relevant limitations with Kuberenetes version 1.18 and lower as it relates to (cloning) across namespaces. (Everything is do-able, 
>it’s just more steps than you might expect.)

January 2021 thru April 2021 - -
>Customer: My company is moving its operations to the cloud, including cloud native computing and Kubernetes. I believe we can run Apache Cassandra 
>on Kubernetes. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! Kubernetes, and running Apache Cassandra on Kuberenetes are huge topics. As such, we’ll begin a four part series of articles that 
>cover most of the day one through day seven topics. We wont do a general Kuberentes primer, many other capable Kubernetes primers exist, but will list our 
>favorite resources here and there. 
>
>  • In the January article, we will get Apache Cassandra up and running on Kubernetes.
