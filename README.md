This is a personal blog where we answer one or more questions each month from DataStax customers in a non-official, non-warranted, non much of anything forum. 

2019 January - - 

>Customer: Graph, graph, graph; what the heck is up with graph- I think (hope ?) there’s something graph 
>databases do that standard relational databases do not, but I can’t articulate what that function or 
>advantage actually is. Can you help ?
>
>Excellent question !  Yes, but we’re going to take two editions of this document to do so. Sometimes 
>there are nuances when discussing databases; what really is the difference between a data warehouse, 
>data mart, data lake, other ? Why couldn’t you recreate some or most non-relational database function 
>using a standard relational database ?

>In this edition of DataStax Developer’s Notebook (DDN), we provide a graph database primer; create a 
>graph, and load it. In a future edition of this same document, we will actually have the chance to 
>provide examples where you might determine that graph databases have an advantage over relational 
>databases for certain use cases.
