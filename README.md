This is a personal blog where we answer one or more questions each month from DataStax customers in a non-official, non-warranted, non much of anything forum.

>Customer: As a database application developer, I’ve never previously used a system with a natively asynchronous 
>client side driver. What do I need to know; Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! Yes, the DataStax Enterprise (DSE) client side drivers offer entirely native 
>asynchronous operation.; fire and forget, or fire and listen. There are easy means to make the driver and 
>any calls your issue block, and behave synchronously, but there’s little fun in that.
>
>The on line documentation covers the asynchronous query topic well, so we’ll review that and then extend 
>into asynchronous write programming.

>Customer: I’ve read all of the articles and documentation related to DataStax Enterprise (DSE) Graph, but am 
>still not certain how these graph queries (traversals) actually execute. To me, this looks much like a SQL 
>query processing engine, and I don’t know how or if to index or model this. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! In this document we’ll give a brief treatment to graph query processing; how 
>graph traversals are actually (executed). For fun, we’ll actually talk a little bit about a close (graph) 
>neighbor, Neo4J.

>Customer: My company maintains a lot of data on Hadoop, in Parquet and other formats, and need to perform integrated 
>reporting with data resident inside DataStax. Can you help ?
>
>Daniel: Excellent question ! Yes. This is like a two-liner solution. We’ll detail all of the concepts and code inside 
>this document.
